# Getting started

This tutorial will guide you through setting up a digital twin and running it

## Start

If you are using poetry, you can go to `odtp` folder and run `poetry shell`. This will load the environment with all dependencies.

On the other hand, if you are using the `docker-compose` solution you can just run `odtp` command directly.

``` sh
odtp dashboard
```

## Now the interface should be up

So you can start working:

![Dashboard serving](../static/tutorials/getting-started/dashboard-start.png){ width="800" }

## Next for shared building blocks

The shared building blocks start with Component Versions:

[Component Versions](component-versions.md){ .md-button }

## Next for user owned projects

The user journey starts at Users:

[Users](users.md){ .md-button }
