# Getting started

This tutorial will guide you through setting up a digital twin and running it

## Start

=== "Dashboard GUI"

    If you are using poetry, you can go to `odtp` folder and run `poetry shell`. This will load the environment with all dependencies.

    On the other hand, if you are using the `docker-compose` solution you can just run `odtp` command directly.

    ``` sh
    odtp dashboard
    ```

=== "Command Line CLI"

    If you are using poetry, you can go to `odtp` folder and run `poetry shell`. This will load the environment with all dependencies.

    On the other hand, if you are using the `docker-compose` solution you can just run `odtp` command directly.

    ``` sh
    odtp --help
    ```

## Now the interface should be up

So you can start working:

=== "Dashboard GUI"

=== "Command Line CLI"

    ![Terminal ready](../static/tutorials/getting-started/cli-start.png){ width="800" }

## Next for shared building blocks

The shared building blocks start with Component Versions:

[Component Versions](components-and-versions.md){ .md-button }

## Next for user owned projects

The user journey starts at Users:

[Users](users.md){ .md-button }
