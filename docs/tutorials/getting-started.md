# Getting started

This tutorial will guide you through setting up a digital twin and running it

## Start

=== "Dashboard GUI"

    If you are using poetry, you can go to `odtp` folder and run `poetry shell`. This will load the enviroment with all dependencies.

    On the other hand, if you are using the `docker-compose` solution you can just run `odtp` command directly.

    ``` sh
    odtp dashboard
    ```

=== "Command Line CLI"

    If you are using poetry, you can go to `odtp` folder and run `poetry shell`. This will load the enviroment with all dependencies.

    On the other hand, if you are using the `docker-compose` solution you can just run `odtp` command directly.

    ``` sh
    odtp --help
    ```

## Now the interface should be up

So you can start working:
