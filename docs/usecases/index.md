# ODTP Use Cases

The development of ODTP is has happened in parallel to the adaptation of different use cases. In this section we list some example use cases from the mobility domain. These use cases came out of the cooperation between CSFM and SDSC, see [Acknowledgement and Funding](../legal/acknowledgement.md).
