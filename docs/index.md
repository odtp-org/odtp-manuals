# ODTP Introduction

With ODTP you can build digital Twins

## What is a digital Twin

In ODTP a digital Twin is a pipeline of containers `components`
that run in sequence

- for now the sequence has to be linear
- in the future the sequence is supposed to by an acyclic graph

## Commandline and Graphical User Interface

You can setup and run these pipelines from both the command line and the graphical user interface.
The startup tutorials will take you through both options in parallel.
